# Air-Quality
This project is primarily a learning exercise but I was interested in how representative new urban air quality data [published](http://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/) by the WHO is of what is happening in my local area.

The project is still work in progress using Python in Jupyter Lab. It is giving me the opportunity to practice skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis and time series analysis.
